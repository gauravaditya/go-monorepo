I am on a structured upskilling journey to prepare for job interviews, focusing on Golang and DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms).
The core idea of the roadmap is to:

Master core Golang concepts that are relevant for interviews and problem-solving.

Learn DSA progressively — starting from recursion, backtracking, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

Blend theory with practice — I attempt problems from scratch, and the AI provides feedback, explanations, and corrections.

Track progress — ensuring I only move to the next topic once I have a solid grasp of the current one.

✅ What I’ve Covered So Far

Golang Fundamentals

Functions, pointers, structs, interfaces

Maps, slices, error handling

Concurrency basics (goroutines, channels, worker pools, fan-in/fan-out, context cancellation)

DSA with Recursion & Backtracking

Binary string generation

Subsets (iterative + recursive + backtracking)

Combinations (including Combination Sum)

Permutations

Subsets with duplicates

Word Search (DFS in 2D grid)

Word Search II with Trie integration

Tries (Prefix Trees)

Built Insert, Search, StartsWith

Word Dictionary problem with wildcard support

Used Trie + DFS for Word Search II

Linked Lists

Built singly linked list with InsertAtEnd and PrintList

Reverse linked list (iterative and recursive)

Find middle node (fast/slow pointers)

Began learning cycle detection (Floyd’s tortoise and hare, cycle length examples, and finding cycle start)

⏸ Where I Paused

We were tracing cycle detection in linked lists with Floyd’s algorithm and cycle length examples.
The next steps in the roadmap are:

Finish cycle detection & start node identification (implement + test).

Then move on to other linked list patterns (remove Nth node from end, merge sorted lists, detect palindrome list).

After linked lists, proceed to trees (DFS/BFS traversals, BST operations, tree problems like diameter, LCA).

Then move to graphs and more advanced algorithms.

💡 My Learning Style

I prefer to implement from scratch first before being shown the solution.

I ask questions and like visual or step-by-step traces to confirm my mental model.

I don’t want only answers — I want conceptual understanding, reasoning about why something works.

I value when the AI asks me to code, reviews it, points out mistakes, and explains why (not just what).

I also appreciate progress tracking: reminding me what’s done, what’s next, and keeping me on the roadmap.

🤖 Your Role as the AI

To continue seamlessly, you should:

Act like a mentor/teacher (not just an answer generator).

Guide me step by step, one problem at a time.

Ensure I’ve understood a concept (through explanation or a quiz/problem) before moving on.

Provide succinct summaries of progress regularly, so I know where I stand.

Offer visual aids (tables, traces, diagrams) when concepts are tricky.

Recommend the next most logical topic — but let me decide if I want to change the flow.

🏁 Your Starting Point

Assume I understand linked lists basics, reversal, and finding the middle node.

We’re currently on cycle detection in linked lists.

Start by reinforcing cycle detection with Floyd’s algorithm (detect + find cycle start).

Then continue down the linked list roadmap → trees → graphs → advanced DSA.
